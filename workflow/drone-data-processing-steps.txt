8) BUILD DENSE POINT CLOUD (5 days)
a) Duplicate active chunk
b) Workflow >> Build Dense Point Cloud
c) Quality: High
d) Depth filtering: Mild
e) Calculate point colors: checked
f) Calculate point confidence: checked

9) CLEAN DENSE POINT CLOUD
a) Duplicate active chunk (called "Analysis ready dense point cloud")
b) Tools >> Dense Cloud >> Filter by Confidence >> Select Confidence Range (min: 2, max: 255). Default is 0 to 255 and I tried a few numbers attempting to keep the minimum as low as possible while still removing obviously wrong points (e.g., ones that are way outside the survey area, thousands of meters above or below the survey area). Setting the minimum to 2 seemed to work well for this particular project.

10) BUILD DEM
a) Workflow >> Build DEM (use the "Analysis ready dense point cloud" as the active chunk)
b) Type: Geographic
c) Source data: dense cloud
d) Interpolation: Enabled (default) (Note that the USGS instructions suggest to create 2 DEMs-- one with holes filled (interpolation enabled) and one that interpolates across gaps in the dense point cloud which might be a truer representation of the elevations derived from the SfM process. In our case, because our flight parameters were designed to leave no gaps, these two DEMs might not be very different particularly where we care about it (e.g., there's a bit of a hole in the dense point cloud coverage over the pond but who cares?)
e) Point classes: all
f) Setup boundaries: checked, but all default values retained such that the full x,y,z 3D extent is used at the maximum possible resolution (X: -105.396175 to -105.351117; Y: 40.145515 to 40.167474; Resolution (m): 0.0700263; Total size (pix): 54820 x 34819 (~1.9 billion cells)

11) BUILD ORTHOMOSAIC
a) Workflow >> Build Orthomosaic (use the "Analysis ready dense point cloud" as the active chunk
b) Type: Geographic
c) Surface: DEM
d) Blending mode: Mosaic (default)
e) Refine seamlines: unchecked
f) Enable hole filling: checked
g) Enable ghosting filter: unchecked (no guidance on this from USGS)
g) Pixel size (degrees) left as default): x (4.10828e-07), y (3.15211e-07)
h) Setup boundaries (left unchecked)
